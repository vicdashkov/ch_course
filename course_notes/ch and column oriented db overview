Hello everyone.

But we'll go through why you would want to use solution like CH

some cool numbers from Yandex
The main cluster of Yandex.Metrica

good stuff about ch file:///Users/viktordashkov/Repos/clickhouse-presentations/evolution/index_en.html#22

CH good parts:
- ingests huge amount of data in realtime
- fast query processing (sub second)
- Strong SQL
- Scales very well vertically (link)
- Horizontally scalable (link)
- Open source

CH bad parts:
- eventual consistency
- no transactions
- single index
- JOINs are not super
- No deletes
