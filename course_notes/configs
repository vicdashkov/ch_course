<insert_quorum>
By default, an INSERT query waits for confirmation of writing the data from only one replica.
If the data was successfully written to only one replica and the server with this replica ceases to exist,
the stored data will be lost. To enable getting confirmation of data writes from multiple replicas,
use the insert_quorum option.
</insert_quorum>

<max_insert_block_size>
The INSERT query is divided into blocks up to max_insert_block_size = 1048576 rows.
</max_insert_block_size>
