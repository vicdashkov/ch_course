We have no choise but to constatly make and consume more and more coffee while waiting for yet another big data
solution to fail on us with out of memory exception.

Jokes aside though,

I'm an engineer in a company that has to do complex anaytics on a datasest with many million rows and
many terrabites of data.
We've also, just like you, had play with ever growing cron jobs to precalculate yet another aggregate.

Well, fear no more. I've got a cure for you.

As a data scientist, you need to have a good grasp of your data.
As an it decision maker, you need to make sure your system metrics show you current state of affairs, not old historical
gurbage

Then you've come to a right place

Join me on this battle to fight and finally win the battle agains time.
