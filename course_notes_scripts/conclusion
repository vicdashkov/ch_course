Thank you for sticking with me for so long.
We've covered some cool stuff from basic to intermediate in this short course.

There's still so much to do; so much to toy with and so much to think about.

But, This course is agile, so we will reiterate many times again and again.

There's definetely no stopping us from excelling at concuring big data.
CH of course is just one tool, but I trully hope you can take it to your company,
give it a new home, and make a good use of it
I'm sure it will not dissapoint.

I want to continue building this course. Building community around clickhouse.

Helping people with complex tasks that can occur in the world of massive data.

And of course I need your help. Please comment, participate in discussions and streign up
shoot me an email with any suggestion or critique about this course.

I hope I've hooked you on ch, and provided some basic building blocks and code snippets to
go ahead and explore the world of CH on your own.

Hope to see you again.

Good luck
