hi everyone, this is Vic again, and

Today we'll talk about dictionaries

Dictionaries in Ch allows us to store, well, dictionaries in ram.

We can connect CH dictionaries to external sources like databases and csv files

Connecting to external DB has obvious benefit of having access to recent data from external source
And csv files could be very useful if you have some heavy jobs running in other parts of your system
You can than mount some kind of network drive on your CH node, and access the result of this job streignt from CH
Very powerful.

We event went as war as using result of dictionary lookups as default values at insertion time
A bit dirty, but works like magic

-- change slide to dict layouts

Clickhouse has 7 different layouts at our disposal
But docs reccomend using flat, hashed and complex_key_hashed layouts
These layouts provide optimal processing speed.

In this video, we'll talk about flat dictionary
The dictionary key has to have UInt64 type and the value is limited to 500,000 elements
Ch will not create flat dictionary if more keys are discovered

Ok, to the action now

-- open course files

This is our good old docker ch.
But this time I've added pokemon_dictionary.xml
and pokemon.csv
this is pretty much all you need to do to start using dict in CH

important fileds in pokemon_dictionary.xml are
dictionary name
lifetime (ch will update our dict at random within specified range)
layout (flat in our case, with limited number of keys)
and structure.
Structure has to represent your csv file.
In our case i've got pokemon id field and mandatory id tag,
as well as pokemon name and pokemon pet name (do pokemons themselfs have pets? not sure)
there's more tinkering you can do, but this will do for now

and let's take a quick look at pokemon.csv. where we see 3 columns we've described before
Please note we've got some empty fields for zalechu and bixby

is it from pokemons?

ok, let's move to the action. i've already got our ch up and running

all seems fine now. lets dbl check ch sees our dict

-- switch to tabix

SELECT * FROM system.dictionaries

and here we see some basic info about our dict

lets quickly create a table for, say, event, surprise
Structure should be fairly familiar to you by now

And insert some stuff as well

let's now try to get something out of our dict

-- switch to tabix tab 3

executing select, and here we can see default values (solo and rex)
for pokemons that are not present in our CSV

Don't like the filed name? no problem we can hot reload our dictionaries on demand
let's try

-- pet_name -> super_pet_name
-- swithc tabix 4; reload
-- rename fields in query

bonus point, lets create dict engine!

-- tabix tab 5

and we can do a join here or a simple select.
so now our dict is just like regular table.
could be very convenient sometimes
dictionary engine was added just recently, so that's nice

Anyway.

-- swithc to slides with summary

I hope you enjoyed this video as much as I did,
see you on the next one!
